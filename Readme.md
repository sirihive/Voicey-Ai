# Prompt for (Build a Real-Time AI-Powered Voice Chatbot with Whisper, Groq API, gTTS, and Gradio)

Create a **voice-to-voice conversational assistant** called **"Voicesy AI"** using Python. The app allows users to speak or type their message, then:

- **Uses Whisper** (OpenAI's ASR) to transcribe spoken input into text.
- **Sends the transcription** or typed text to **Groq API** for intelligent, context-aware responses.
- **Converts the AI-generated response** into speech using **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech).
- Provides an interactive and beautiful web interface using **Gradio**, supporting both **voice** and **text modes**.

## üåç Features:
- **Dual Input (Voice & Text)**: Users can either speak or type their message, making the chatbot accessible to a wider audience.
- **Real-Time Audio Transcription and Response**: Spoken words are instantly transcribed to text, processed by the AI, and responded with natural-sounding speech.
- **Smart AI-Generated Replies** powered by **Groq API**: The app uses **Groq API** for deep learning model-based conversational responses, ensuring intelligent and context-aware interactions.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Choose from various accents and languages for voice responses, including options like **en-UK**, **en-AU**, **fr**, **de**, and more.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Easy-to-use interface with tabs for different modes:
  - **Voice-to-Voice**: Speak directly and receive spoken responses.
  - **Text-to-Speech**: Type your text and have it converted to audio.
  - **About Page**: Learn more about the app and its developer, along with contact information.
- **Voice Dropdown**: Select from different voices (e.g., en, en-UK, en-AU, fr, de, es) for diverse, personalized experiences.

## üîß Tech Stack:
- **Python**: The backend programming language.
- **Whisper**: OpenAI‚Äôs Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to transcribe speech to text with high accuracy.
- **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech): Converts AI-generated text responses into speech.
- **Groq API**: Power the chatbot's natural language understanding and response generation, ensuring intelligent conversations.
- **Gradio**: A user-friendly web framework that simplifies interface creation for machine learning applications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:
1. **Voice Input (Optional)**: The user can either upload an audio file or speak directly to the app. If audio is provided, Whisper transcribes the speech to text.
2. **Text Input**: Alternatively, the user can type their message directly.
3. **Processing**: The transcribed text or typed input is then sent to the **Groq API**, where the AI processes it and generates an intelligent response.
4. **Response Output**: The AI-generated response is then converted to speech via **gTTS** and played back to the user.
5. **Multiple Languages and Voices**: Users can choose from a variety of voices and accents in the voice selection dropdown.
