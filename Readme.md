# Prompt for (Voicey AI)
Create an interactive real-time voice-to-voice conversational assistant named Voicesy AI.
This app will allow users to speak or type their message, and it will:

- Transcribe spoken input to text using Whisper (OpenAIâ€™s Automatic Speech Recognition).
- Send the transcription or typed text to the Groq API for intelligent, context-aware responses.
- Convert the AI-generated response into speech using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
- Provide an interactive, user-friendly interface using Gradio, supporting both voice and text modes.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Backend development.
- **Whisper**: Speech-to-text transcription.
- **gTTS**: Converts text to speech.
- **Groq API**: Intelligent, context-aware response generation.
- **Gradio**: Frontend for building the web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** (for running the app)
- **Whisper**: `pip install openai-whisper`
- **gTTS**: `pip install gTTS`
- **Gradio**: `pip install gradio`
- **Groq API Client**: `pip install groq`

Ensure you have a **Groq API Key**

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Setup Whisper for Transcribing Audio Input

1. Install the Whisper library and load the desired model (tiny, base, etc.).
2. Use Whisper to transcribe spoken words into text.

### Integrate Groq API for Generating AI Responses

1. Create a client instance of Groq with your API key.
2. Set up a function that takes text input and generates a response using Groq's conversational model.

### Text-to-Speech with gTTS

1. Use the gTTS library to convert the AI-generated text responses into speech.
2. Save the audio response to a file.

### Create Gradio Interface

Build a web interface with Gradio that includes:

- A tab for **Voice to Voice** interaction, allowing users to speak and receive spoken responses.
- A tab for **Text to Speech**, where users type text and get audio responses.
- A tab for **About App**, explaining the app and its developer.
- Add a voice dropdown allowing users to choose different accents and voices (e.g., en-UK, en-AU, fr, etc.).
